>"In 2023, Bangalore and Pune recorded the longest traffic delays in India during rush hours, with commuters spending an average of 257 hours per year stuck in traffic. Mumbai followed closely behind, with individuals spending 198 hours annually in traffic during peak times. Furthermore, Bangalore had the highest average travel time, taking 28 minutes to cover just 10 kilometers."


## Problem Statement

Urban traffic congestion causes significant delays, economic losses, and fuel wastage, impacting productivity and daily life. Many lack real-time traffic insights, especially non-smartphone users. GoTej addresses this by providing instant, multilingual traffic updates via SMS and WhatsApp, enabling smarter and faster travel decisions.

## **Process Flow of GoTej**  

Hereâ€™s how **GoTej** works in simple steps:

### **1. User Request (Input)**  
- A user sends a message (via **WhatsApp** or **SMS**) with a location name.  
  - Example: **"Traffic Bengaluru"**  


### **2. Backend Processing**  
- The **Node.js backend receives the request**.  
- The backend extracts the **location name** from the message.

### **3. Fetching Traffic Data**  
- The backend calls the **Google Maps API** to fetch live traffic data for that location.  
- It also estimates **how long it will take for traffic to clear**.

### **4. Language Translation (If Needed)**  
- If the user has selected a preferred language, the response is translated using the **Google Cloud Translation API**.  
  - Example: If the user prefers **Hindi**, the message is translated before being sent back.

### **5. Sending the Response**  
- The processed traffic update is sent back to the user via **WhatsApp or SMS**, using the **Twilio API**.

### **6. Optional Features**  
- **Machine Learning (Future Enhancement)**: AI-based prediction of traffic clearance time.  
- **Web Dashboard (Optional)**: A **React.js** dashboard where users can check traffic visually.
